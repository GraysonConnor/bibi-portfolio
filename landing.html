     <h4>Hey</h4>

     <p>I'm Bibi Connor, a web designer based out of Austin, Texas.</p>
     <p>I was born with creativity in my blood, but I fell in love with design after discovering its influence in small business.</p>
     <p>Since then, I've been chasing my fascination with intentional and communicative design. I have found that usability and
     adaptability lead to the most successful design campaigns.</p>
